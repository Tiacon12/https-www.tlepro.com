Poetry By Tiah: Up/Down Emotions 
If you look up what do you see?, if you looked around what do you find? 
and if you looked down does that really mean your down? who really know's 
b/c your the only one that have control over your emotions do you trust yourself
enough to let things go or are your feelings ment to stay and drown in an ocean, ask 
yourself is what your doing in life really worth it to you or are you doing it for
someone else your close to and others around you? are they helping you out or 
are they using you to get their work done and at the end of the day is it 
you that's happy or are they just having fun, if you look up you see something 
blue but is that really a reason or explannation to say the sky is blue or even the 
reflection of an ocean, does color really define the creation of an object we're 
surounded by, if so why do people think a skin color is a bad or good flaw that defines 
a human beings well being of the type of person they might be or act like, when you look
down most people get the impressian that your sad or mad, when really your just minding your own 
P&Q's, but when you look down on the ground are you looking for something or does our heads
just eventually get tired of looking up and around?.
